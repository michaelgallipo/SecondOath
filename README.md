# SecondOath
<p><strong>Second Oath</strong> was originally a project created for the BostonHacks Hackathon in Nov 2018.</p>
<br>
<p> This version is my attempt to recreate and refactor the app using a Ruby (Sinatra) back-end and Vue front-end.</p>
<br>
<p> The original team consisted of Alexandra Thomson, Ethan Caldwell, and Michael Gallipo</p>
